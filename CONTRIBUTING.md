# Contributing to Ozarqa
Thanks for considering contributing.
With the help of contributors like you, Ozarqa will work better for everyone.

## How can I contribute?

### Fire an issue
We can't test Ozarqa on every browser and device. There are always some edge cases in which Ozarqa may not run properly. 
Fire an issue when it doesn't work for you. This not only helps you,  also prevent others from facing the same issue.
**Notes for firing issues:**
- Before you fire an issue, make sure you update to the latest version of each main version. (e.g. v2.9.4 for version 2)
- Provide the OS and browser version.
- Provide a link or your plugin options.

### Request missing features
It's those who use Ozarqa shape the future of this project. 
If there is one missing part which you really need in your project, let us know and we will try to add it.
